# RecipePantry

Recipe Pantry is a social media application designed to assist those looking to share, receive, and search for recipes. Our app makes usability the utmost priority for the end of streamlining users towards discovering the recipes they're going to be most interested in. The flames fueling the fire behind Recipe Pantry cook in Recipe Creation and Cookbook Curation. The former allows one to title a recipe, describe the ingredients and preparation steps therein, and to accompany it with an appetizing image. Cookbooks allow for the collation of recipes into a cohesive whole - say a collection of Latin cuisine, or perhaps Asian Fusion? Recipe Pantry grants the whole world of cuisine at an instant!
