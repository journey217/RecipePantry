<h2>Bio:</h2>
<p>I am a Senior Computer Science student at University at Buffalo. I currently work at VOCAL Technologies part-time. </br>
    I liked the idea of a recipe app because I thought that could useful in my everyday life. As someone who lives in an off-campus apartment, </br>
    I am always cooking my own meals. Whether its due to money or my dietary restrictions, I always find myself cooking the same meals. </br>
    With Recipe Pantry, I am hoping to help create an online community where diverse people can come together to share something I think we are all </br>
    passionate about, food. I am hoping that with the successful development of this app, I can actually expand my diet lol.
