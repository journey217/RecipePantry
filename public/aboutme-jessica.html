            <h2>Bio:</h2>
            <p>I'm Jessica Mui, a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University at Buffalo. I'm passionate about UI/UX design and love learning about product & urban design. As someone who began cooking frequently this past year due to living off-campus, I'm excited to be working on Recipe Pantry!</p>
