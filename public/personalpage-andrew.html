<p> I'm a senior CS student at University at Buffalo due to graduate in the summer of 2024. </br>
As someone who's been trying to cook more, I was definitely interested in developing a recipe/cookbook app. By the end of our development cycle, we'll have hopefully deployed a successful and novel product, and I'll have hopefully picked up healthier dietary habits. </br>
In my free time, I like to read, play guitar, and watch movies.
